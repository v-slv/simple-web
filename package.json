  "description": "My first attempt to  demonstrate how to use modern JS features to simplify the web development. The motivation for this project is to help the web dev to evolve in a more clean and simple process, avoiding too many tools/frameworks/complex patterns and paradigms that could become to hard to manage on mid-long dev cycle. My belive is that the web apps should stay as simple as possible, allowing developers to focus on their specific use case  rather than always trying  to learn complex frameworks/patterns/paradigms that are designed in a very generic sense.",
