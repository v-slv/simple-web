My first attempt to  demonstrate how to use modern JS features to simplify the web development. The motivation for this project is to help the web dev to evolve in a more clean and simple process, avoiding too many tools/frameworks/librariers/complex patterns and paradigms that could become to hard to manage on mid-late dev cycle. My belive is that the web apps should stay as simple as possible, allowing developers to focus on their specific problem rather than understanding a complex generic framework.


Manifest:
- Use simpler and smaller "app stateless" tools implemented as modules that could be imported on demand to solve very specific problems
- Avoid generic, stricly required patterns that intend to solve all of the problems. While the intention is good, sometimes it constrains too much the developer and make the architecture definition process too painful because you need to fit your specific solution in a predefined generic pattern.
- Avoid the blackbox magic. Every tool or function should be highly transparent. While the logic abstraction and code reuse is extremly beneficial, I belive sometimes the existing frameworks are trying to hide too many things behind the scene and therefore nothing is really well understood.
- Avoid browser native behaviour hijacking (e.g Single Page Apps routers) 
- The Web and programming is fun. There should be no fear in deviating from a pattern. 


Disclaimer: All of the things described here are based on my current knowledge which could be a more or less reflection of the reality. The ideas could change frequently based on my experience evolution. Is more like trying to see if the things could be better rather than criticizing some ideas or the previous work of others which I really respect.
